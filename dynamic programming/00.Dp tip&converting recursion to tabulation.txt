steps of solving a dp question
1)try to represent the problem in terms of index.
2)try all the possible stuff,with respect to the question,on that index
3)If question is:
  i)find all ways=sum all stuff
  ii)find min=minimum of all stuff
  iii)find max=max of all stuff

4)When we are doing multi dimensional dp.Sometimes we may update only one index of the dp.usually we do that with target and understand that easily
but sometimes we have to keep the index unchanged.This is done to get all possible sequences.

5)Steps to convert Recursion to Tabulation
i)First just check if in the recursion,we have any negative index based call eg if(j<0) return 1; In this ,-1 is called but no where is it stored in dp so no problem.But when we are going to convert it to tabulation,we cant have the -1 call.So what we do is that we increment all index by 1,ie we will take a dp of
dp[n+1][m+1] instead of dp[n][m].MAKE SURE YOU DECLARE CORRECT DP AND ALL FOR LOOP HAVE CORRECT LIMIT ie i<n+1

ii)Write base conditions ie fill dp array with the base condition values.
iii)copy the code(Recurence) as it is and just change the recursion calls to dp array calls
iv)Tabulation coded is ready
