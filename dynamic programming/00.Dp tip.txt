steps of solving a dp question
1)try to represent the problem in terms of index.
2)try all the possible stuff,with respect to the question,on that index
3)If question is:
  i)find all ways=sum all stuff
  ii)find min=minimum of all stuff
  iii)find max=max of all stuff

4)When we are doing multi dimensional dp.Sometimes we may update only one index of the dp.usually we do that with target and understand that easily
but sometimes we have to keep the index unchanged.This is done to get all possible sequences.
