*)In string questions,we have questions commonly on subsequence.Subsequence is taking letters of elements from a string string an forming a new string.But the order should be mentained
ie we dont need to take the consequtive elements,we can take an element and skip the next and take the one after that,but we should only choose in the order of the
original string

*)Like we had take and not take in dp on subsequences, we have match or not match in dp on strings.

*)One of the most important concept of dp on string is LCS that is longest common subsequence.LCS is used in many questions and its application can be found/understood directly or indirectly.
