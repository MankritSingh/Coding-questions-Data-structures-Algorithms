IMP s.begin() points to the first item but s.end() points to the element after the last element.Thats how iterators work

Map-Key value pair
similar to dictionary of Python and hashmap of java
there are 3 type of map-map,unordered map and multimap

Map(ordered)-use when we want sorted key or want to traverse in increasing or decreasing order
#The key or value can even be complex data types like array vector etc
1.Implemented using red black tree.Therefore the key values are stored in sorted order.
2.Important time complexities
  a.Insertion:Single element:O(logn)+rebalance of tree where n is size of the map.
              N elements:O(nlogn)
  b.Finding key:Single element:O(logn)+rebalance of tree where n is size of the map.
              N elements:O(nlogn)
  c.Deletion:Single element:O(logn)+rebalance of tree where n is size of the map.
              N elements:O(nlogn)
  d.Search:logn
            
            
Map(unordered)-Can be used for hashing
1.Implemented Hash table.Therefore the key values are stored in unsorted order.
2.Important time complexities
  a.Insertion:Single element:O(1) average and O(n) worst case
  b.Finding key:same as above
  c.Deletion:same as above
  d.Search:same as above
